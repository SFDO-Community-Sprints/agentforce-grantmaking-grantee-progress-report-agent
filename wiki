Implementation Considerations:

* Deploy the flow & prompt launcher(s) as a button in order to control flex credit consumption
* Expose flow & prompt launcher to a smaller subset of users when testing to evaluate patterns of credit consumption
* If you receive requirement documents in other languages, add the specific language the prompt should use for the summary output
* If you receive PII as part of your requirements, be advised that the document may not mask all PII prior to sending to the LLM



Known Issues:

* Summaries will only review PDF formatted documents in v1



Project Parking Lot:

* Enhancement - Comparison of Intended Outcomes vs Funding Award Summarization
* Enhancement - Provide automated way for Requirement summaries to be retained in a Note upon a re-summarization of the Requirement
* Enhancement - Agentic actions for creating/updating Outcome-related objects when the prompt analyzes the Requirement doc(s)
